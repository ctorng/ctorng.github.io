        <h3>Efficient Task-Based Parallel Runtimes</h3>

        <p>Task-based parallel runtimes underpin the parallelization of
        frameworks for machine learning, graph analytics, and other
        domains. State-of-the-art graph analytics frameworks like GraphIt
        and Ligra are designed on top of these runtimes to enable
        efficient task distribution using dynamic work-stealing
        algorithms. A cross-stack research approach can expose
        runtime-level information to hardware to influence both
        architecture-level and VLSI-level decisions to improve performance
            and energy efficiency of the runtime (<b><a
        href="pdfs/torng-aaws-isca2016.pdf">ISCA'16</a></b>). However,
        walls of abstraction often make it challenging to pass information
        through layers of the computing stack. I worked on a systematic
        approach to convey the abstraction of a "task" from the runtime
        directly to the underlying hardware (<b><a
        href="pdfs/kim-lta-micro2017.pdf">MICRO'17</a></b>). I designed
        and fabricated <a href="#chips"><i>BRGTC2</i></a>, a
        6.7M-transistor chip in TSMC 28nm, to collect performance, area,
        and energy numbers in an advanced technology node to support
        future research projects based on hardware acceleration for
        task-based parallel runtimes (<b><a
        href="pdfs/torng-brgtc2-riscvday2018.pdf">RISCV'18</a></b>).</p>

        <h3>Integrated Voltage Regulation</h3>

        <p>Voltage regulators are responsible for efficiently converting
        one voltage level into another (e.g., board-level to chip-level).
        Recent technology trends are making it feasible to replace
        discrete voltage regulators with integrated voltage regulators,
        which can significantly reduce system cost by eliminating
        expensive board-level components. The enabling trends include
        energy storage elements with better energy densities as well as
        faster on-chip switches with lower parasitic losses. However,
        integrated voltage regulators are very large (e.g., similar area
        as the core it supplies). Together with my colleagues in the
        circuits field, I applied a cross-stack research approach to
        explore a novel technique that dynamically shares capacitance
        across multiple loads for a 40% reduction in regulator area while
        still enabling fine-grain DVFS (<b><a
        href="pdfs/godycki-rpdn-micro2014.pdf">MICRO'14</a></b>). I also
        contributed to the fabrication of a
        <a href="#chips">switched-capacitor-based prototype in 65nm
        CMOS</a> resulting in a journal publication in a top-tier circuits
        venue (<b><a

        <h3>Rapid ASIC Design</h3>

        <p>Rising SoC design costs have created a formidable barrier to
        hardware design when using traditional design tools and
        methodologies. It is exceedingly difficult for small teams with a
        limited workforce to build meaningfully complex chips for
        business ventures (e.g., chip-based startups in machine learning),
        in academia (i.e., research groups), and even for government goals
        (e.g., U.S. Department of Defense).
        To combat some of these challenges, I lead the development of <a
        href="https://github.com/mflowgen/mflowgen">mflowgen</a>, an
        open-source tool for integrating agile design principles into ASIC
        and FPGA design flows.
        I have also been involved in a
        range of efforts to reduce the costs and challenges of ASIC design
        for small teams based on productive toolflows and open-source
        hardware. I was the Cornell University student lead on the <a
        href="#chips">Celerity Open-Source 511-Core RISC-V Tiered
        Accelerator Fabric</a> resulting in top-tier publications in
        chip-design venues (<b><a
        href="pdfs/ajayi-celerity-slides-hotchips2017.pdf">HOTCHIPS'17</a></b>),
        architecture venues (<b><a
        href="pdfs/davidson-celerity-ieeemicro2018.pdf">IEEE-MICRO'18</a></b>),
        and various workshops. I was also the project lead for <a
          href="#chips">BRGTC1</a> and <a href="#chips">BRGTC2</a>, which
        are silicon prototypes in IBM 130nm and TSMC 28nm designed and
        implemented using a new open-source Python-based hardware modeling
        framework called PyMTL developed by my research group. Finally, I
        contributed to an effort at NVIDIA Research on a modular digital
        VLSI flow for high-productivity SoC design based on high-level
        synthesis tools (<b><a
        href="pdfs/khailany-nvidia-matchlib-dac2018.pdf">DAC'18</a></b>).</p>
